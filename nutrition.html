A balanced diet includes a variety of wholesome foods like lean proteins, whole grains, healthy fats, and plenty of fruits and vegetables. These foods provide essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants to promote energy, muscle development, and a strong immune system. Prioritizing nutrient-dense meals not only helps maintain an ideal weight but also fosters long-term health, vitality, and resilience. A mindful approach to eating can make reaching and maintaining your perfect weight an enjoyable, sustainable journey.</p>

        <li><h2> Lean Protein: </h2></li>
        <p> Sources like chicken, turkey, fish, eggs, tofu, and legumes provide high-quality protein, essential for muscle maintenance and metabolism. Protein helps keep you full longer and stabilizes energy levels. </p>
        <li><h2> Whole Grains: </h2></li>
        <p> Opt for complex carbs like quinoa, brown rice, oats, barley, and whole-grain bread, which provide steady energy, fiber, and essential vitamins and minerals. They support a healthy digestive system and keep you full. </p>
        <li><h2> Vegetables: </h2></li>

        <li><h2> Healthy Fats: </h2></li>
        <p> Avocado, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and fatty fish (like salmon) contain unsaturated fats and omega-3 fatty acids that support brain health, reduce inflammation, and provide sustained energy. </p>
        <li><h2> Fruits: </h2></li>
        <p> Include a variety of fruits such as berries, apples, oranges, bananas, and grapes for fiber, antioxidants, and natural sweetness that satisfy sugar cravings while providing essential nutrients.</p>
        <li><h2> Dairy or Dairy Alternatives: </h2></li>
        <p> Low-fat dairy options like Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, or fortified plant-based alternatives (almond, soy, oat milk) provide protein, calcium, and probiotics beneficial for digestion and bone health. </p>

    <section id="Overweight">
        <h1> Nutritious Food For Overweight</h1>
        <p> For those working toward a healthier weight, focusing on nutrient-dense foods is key to achieving lasting results. Instead of restrictive diets, a balanced approach that emphasizes whole foods—like lean proteins, fiber-rich vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats—can support weight loss and overall well-being. Nutrient-dense foods provide essential vitamins and minerals, promote satiety, and help regulate metabolism without excess calories. This approach allows for gradual, sustainable weight management while also fostering energy, mental clarity, and improved health. Making mindful food choices can turn the journey to a healthier weight into a positive, rewarding experience.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><h2> High-Fiber Vegetables: </h2></li>
        <p> Fill your plate with leafy greens (spinach, kale), cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower), and other fiber-rich veggies like zucchini and carrots. These are low in calories but high in volume, helping you feel full without excess calories. </p>
        <li><h2> Lean Proteins: </h2></li>
        <p> Sources like skinless chicken, turkey, fish, tofu, and legumes are excellent for preserving muscle mass and increasing satiety. Protein helps stabilize blood sugar and can reduce cravings throughout the day. </p>
        <li><h2> Whole Grains in Moderation: </h2></li>
        <p>  Foods like quinoa, barley, brown rice, and oats are fiber-rich and provide slow-digesting carbs, offering long-lasting energy. Be mindful of portion sizes, as whole grains are calorie-dense. </p>
        <li><h2> Fruits Low in Sugar: </h2></li>
        <p> Choose low-sugar fruits such as berries, apples, and pears, which are high in fiber and antioxidants. These options satisfy sweet cravings with less impact on blood sugar. </p>
        <li><h2> Healthy Fats in Moderation: </h2></li>
        <p> Avocado, nuts, seeds, and olive oil provide essential fatty acids that support heart health and satiety. Keep portions small, as fats are calorie-dense. </p>
        <li><h2> Probiotic-Rich Foods: </h2></li>
        <p> Greek yogurt, kefir, kimchi, and sauerkraut help support digestion and may promote a healthy gut microbiome, which can influence weight management. </p>
        <li><h2> Green Tea or Herbal Teas: </h2></li>
        <p> Green tea contains catechins, which may boost metabolism and fat oxidation. Herbal teas can be a satisfying, calorie-free way to reduce cravings. </p>
        </ul>
